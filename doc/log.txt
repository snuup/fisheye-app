currently only outgoing links in stats -> make switchable

make weight switchable

adjacency matrix (page 462)

countries !

degree rank - degree order number

degree diagram - bins with types stacked

radial stack -> each flow a circle

icons

arrows in node circle to indicate in / out

app frame

can select nodes to get their main display / property grid display ?

operations:
- select node
- flood suspect
- pin board
- scoping: link type
- grouping ?
- path list
- mute
- lens -> detail view
- selection: single link, all of a type,
- summary stats for the current model

a small set of efficient tools
great and complex explanation of the effect of those tools


// adjacency matrix:
model: simple
flood nodes into ->
cool visualisation for that fludding
