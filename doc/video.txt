this is the tool we used to analyze fisheys graph data.

from the 3500 nodeis we excluded 1500 numbrs and guids and analyzed the remaining 2000 for words hinting illegal activities.
lavinia used chatgpt which revealed words we did not know before like "contraband". we also manually search through the list

the distribution of the weights in the links motivates us to just use all links.
we found that nost links connect the expected nodes of types, 
    for instance ownership links relate orgs to orgs or persons to orgs
    or family re link mainly persons

    but we find fr between orgs 
    and even fr vessels

    we interpret such links that the owners of the 2 vessels are family related
